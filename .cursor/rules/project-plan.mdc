## Key Learnings from AI Engine and WordPress MCP

### From AI Engine:
- **MCP Integration**: AI Engine has excellent MCP implementation that allows external AI agents to control WordPress
- **Function Calling**: Robust function calling with strict mode and comprehensive error handling
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time communication with streaming support
- **Context Management**: Advanced context window management for large content
- **Security**: Comprehensive security with role-based access and banned words
- **Extensibility**: Plugin ecosystem integration with other Meow Apps plugins

### From WordPress MCP:
- **Dual Transport**: STDIO and HTTP-based (Streamable) transports for flexibility
- **JWT Authentication**: Enterprise-grade authentication system
- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: Standardized API for AI agent interactions
- **Extensible Architecture**: Custom tools, resources, and prompts support
- **Security**: Multi-layer authentication and audit logging
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with 200+ test cases

### Implementation Strategy:
1. **Phase 1**: Complete streaming chat foundation and modular tool architecture (current)
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced context management and tool orchestration
3. **Phase 3**: MCP server implementation for external AI agent support
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features and ecosystem integration

## Agent Tool Architecture (Current Implementation)

- **Agent core** (`Wordsurf_Agent_Core`) is responsible for message preparation, system prompts, and calling the API handler.
- **API handler** (`Wordsurf_OpenAI`) is a pure HTTP client: it only POSTs the body it is given, with no knowledge of tools, prompts, or business logic.
- **REST API handler** (`Wordsurf_REST_API`) is a minimal streaming proxy that forwards requests to OpenAI and streams responses back.
- **Frontend** (`WordsurfChatStream`) handles real-time streaming display and user interaction.
- **Tools** will be modular PHP classes in `includes/agent/core/tools/`, each extending a `Wordsurf_BaseTool` class (planned).
- **Extensibility**: New tools can be added as new classes, and the agent core can route tool calls as needed.

### Immediate Next Steps

- Implement `Wordsurf_BaseTool` class with standard interface (`get_name`, `execute`).
- Create `ReadPostTool` as the first modular tool implementation.
- Enhance agent core to orchestrate tool execution and handle tool results.
- Integrate tool results with the streaming chat interface.
