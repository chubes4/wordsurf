# Wordsurf Development Plan

## Immediate (Next Steps)

1. **üîç IN PROGRESS: OpenAI Responses API Event Format Investigation**
   - **Issue**: Getting HTTP 200 responses but empty content from OpenAI Responses API
   - **Root Cause**: Mismatch between expected SSE event types and what OpenAI actually sends in 2025
   - **Debug Strategy**: Added comprehensive logging to `Wordsurf_Response_Stream_Parser` to capture actual OpenAI event format
   - **Critical Note**: Using OpenAI Responses API (`/v1/responses`) with `gpt-4.1` model - DO NOT revert to Chat Completions API
   - **Next**: Monitor debug logs to identify actual event types, then update parser accordingly
   - **Debug Command**: `tail -f /path/to/logs/error.log | grep "Wordsurf DEBUG"`

2. **‚úÖ COMPLETED: OpenAI Streaming Format Compatibility**
   - ‚úÖ Updated backend `Wordsurf_Response_Stream_Parser` to handle new OpenAI format (`response.output_item.done`)
   - ‚úÖ Maintained backward compatibility with legacy format
   - ‚úÖ Preserved clean frontend architecture - no translation layer needed
   - ‚úÖ Fixed diff display issue - tools now properly trigger frontend diff system
   - **Result**: All tools (edit_post, insert_content, write_to_post) now work with proper diff previews

3. **User Experience Polish**
   - Replace generic "Sorry, there was an error" with specific, actionable error messages
   - Add progressive loading indicators and estimated time display for tool operations
   - Implement undo/redo functionality for tool operations (safe experimentation)
   - Enhance keyboard shortcuts and mobile responsiveness in chat interface

4. **Remove Debug Performance Overhead**
   - Remove console.log statements cluttering the developer console (affects fluidity)
   - Clean up error_log statements that add unnecessary network overhead
   - Streamline debugging to not impact user experience
   - **EXCEPTION**: Keep debugging logs in `Wordsurf_Response_Stream_Parser` until current SSE format issue is resolved

5. **Enhanced Tool Feedback**
   - Add content statistics display (word count changes, character differences)
   - Implement real-time progress indicators for longer operations  
   - Show estimated completion times for tool execution
   - Add visual feedback during diff application process

## V1 Core Feature Roadmap (Post-Foundation)

**Priority**: These 4 features represent the core v1 that would make Wordsurf genuinely revolutionary in the WordPress ecosystem. Only begin after current foundation tools are bulletproof.

### 1. Site Content Search Tool
- **Tool**: `search_site_content` - semantic search across all site posts, pages, and custom post types
- **Capability**: Find and reference existing content to link to, quote from, or build upon
- **Impact**: Transforms isolated post editing into connected content strategy
- **Implementation**: WordPress database queries with relevance scoring, automatic link insertion
- **Example**: "Find related posts about SEO to link to" ‚Üí AI finds relevant content and suggests contextual links

### 2. Google Search Console Integration
- **Tool**: `gsc_keyword_lookup` - real-time integration with Google Search Console API
- **Capability**: Pull ranking data, search volume, click-through rates, and performance metrics
- **Impact**: Data-driven SEO optimization instead of guessing at keyword strategy
- **Implementation**: GSC API authentication, keyword performance analysis, content optimization suggestions
- **Example**: "Optimize this post for better rankings" ‚Üí AI analyzes GSC data and suggests specific improvements

### 3. Persistent Chat History System
- **Custom Post Type**: `wordsurf_conversations` with post relationship management
- **Capability**: Save complete chat sessions while starting fresh context windows for new conversations
- **Benefits**: Return to posts weeks later and continue naturally with full context
- **Example**: Return to post weeks later and see entire conversation history + continue naturally

### 4. Conversation Checkpoint System
- **Architecture**: State snapshots at each user message capturing both content state and conversation state
- **Capability**: "Time travel" editing - revert to any previous state and modify prompts/content from that point
- **Impact**: Risk-free experimentation, conversation branching, perfect prompt iteration
- **Implementation**: Content versioning, conversation state management, branching logic
- **Example**: Try 5 different editing approaches, compare results, revert to message #3 and try different phrasing

**V1 Complete**: With these 4 features + rock-solid foundation tools = genuinely revolutionary WordPress AI plugin with unique value proposition in the market.

## High Priority

1. **Fluid Error Recovery**
   - Add automatic retry mechanisms for failed API calls with exponential backoff

   - Provide suggested alternative actions when operations fail
   - Add "try again" buttons with intelligent retry logic

2. **Advanced Loading & Feedback States**
   - Progressive loading indicators showing operation stages
   - Real-time status updates during tool execution ("Analyzing content...", "Generating changes...", "Applying modifications...")
   - Smooth transitions between different tool states
   - Visual preview animations before changes are applied

3. **Chat Interface Fluidity**
   - Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter for send, Esc for cancel)
   - Implement auto-resize textarea that grows with content
