### Phase 3: MCP Server Implementation (Medium Priority)
**Based on WordPress MCP patterns:**
- Implement dual transport architecture (STDIO and HTTP)
- Add JWT authentication system
- Create core WordPress tools exposure
- Add JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant endpoints

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Basic MCP server structure
2. JWT authentication implementation
3. Core WordPress tools (posts, pages, media)
4. Transport protocol support

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
**Based on both plugins' advanced features:**
- External MCP server connections
- Advanced AI agent integration

### 2. MCP Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Implement MCP server for external AI agent support
**Rationale**: WordPress MCP's dual transport architecture provides flexibility for different AI clients
**Implementation**: Start with HTTP transport, add STDIO support later

### 3. Security Model
**Decision**: Multi-layer security with JWT authentication and capability checking
**Rationale**: WordPress MCP's enterprise-grade security provides robust protection
**Implementation**: JWT authentication for MCP, WordPress capability checking for all operations

### 4. Context Management
**Decision**: Advanced context window management with conversation state
**Rationale**: AI Engine's context management handles large content effectively
**Implementation**: Implement context window management and conversation state preservation

### 5. Real-time Communication
**Decision**: Streaming responses with real-time feedback
**Rationale**: AI Engine's streaming implementation provides excellent user experience
**Implementation**: Use OpenAI streaming with real-time UI updates
